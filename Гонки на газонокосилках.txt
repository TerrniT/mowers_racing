## Start

A group of motorists in the English town of Wisborough Green really wanted to participate in real races. But there was no way.
Each time, according to tradition, they gathered in their warm company in the evening in a pub and dreamed of real rallies.
But, alas, they did not have the money for this. And then one day one of the members of the company - Jim Gavin - had an idea: why not arrange a race on lawn mowers?
After all, almost everyone has unpretentious grass mowing machines. Jim's proposal was enthusiastically supported by his friends.
So, in 1973, a new type of motorcycle racing was born in the Cricketers Arms pub.

## Three main points

The main goal of the creators of a new type of racing was to ensure their availability for a wide range of motorists of different ages and income levels.
Therefore, the most important point was the observance of the established rules that do not allow the spirit of commerce and mercantilism to enter the competition.
Their main points are the requirements - not to establish cash prizes, not to use subsidies, all proceeds to be directed to charitable purposes.

## BLMRA (British Lawn Mower Racing Association)

As you know, where there are three Englishmen, there is a club. Quite naturally, the British Lawn Mower Racing Association (BLMRA) was formed.
She began every year (from May to October) to hold various competitions in a new sport. The largest of them are the British Grand Prix, the World Championship.
The most popular and difficult are the 12-hour races, which require special endurance from the participants, as distances of hundreds of miles are overcome during this time.

The promotion of lawnmower races was facilitated by the participation of celebrities in them - famous British racing drivers Sir Stirling Moss and Derek Bell, actor Oliver Reed.
The popularity was also facilitated by the fixation of achievements on lawn mowers in the Guinness Book of Records.
In 1992, the maximum distance in a 12-hour lawn mower race was 468 km.
In 1997 - the longest journey on a lawn mower - 5417 km.

## Around the world on lawnmowers

Soon, a new kind of motorcycle racing spread from good old England to the New World, Australia and around the world.

In the US, the first competition came in 1992. After visiting England and the British Lawn Mower Racing Association, STA-BIL fuel stabilizer manufacturers organized
entertaining racing named after the brand yourself favorite. They timed them for April Fool's Day (April 1) - they wanted more fun, and they did it.
The result was the U.S. Lawn Mower Racing Association (USLMRA) and many other associations, clubs and races,
including computer game Lawnmower Racing Mania, 2007.

In Australia, ironically, it all started with a pub too. Australian subjects of Her Majesty from the town of Harriettville, Victoria, huddled - who wins,
and away we go - over the hills of the surrounding terrain on lawn mowers. And in May 2009, it was already a national race between all the clubs in the country.

## Formula 1 lawns

Chasing now on the bolide of four classes.

The first is the most democratic and budgetary, accessible to anyone really. Simple lawn mowers take part in it,
behind which athletes run, pushing them and developing the speed they are capable of.

The second, third and fourth classes are four-wheeled lawn mowers that resemble a tractor in appearance and reach speeds of up to 80 kilometers per hour or more.
Each class has its own rules, regulated, among other things, by the local federations of the host country, its own improvements and tuning of bolide, its pilots' own subtleties and tricks.

One thing remains unchanged - these are the most democratic and absolutely non-commercial charitable races that have provided and continue to provide financial assistance to many people,
caught in difficult life situations, and local authorities in solving a number of social and other problems. Here and help to needy students of colleges, and the organization
Christmas and other holidays for the population, and the fight against forest fires in Australia, and much more.
